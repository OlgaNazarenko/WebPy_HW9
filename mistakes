quote.xpath('.//div[@class="tags"]/a/text()').getall() is used to extract the text content of all
the <a> tags within the <div class="tags"> element. The .xpath() method is used to select elements
using XPath selectors, which is a language used to navigate XML documents. The .getall() method is
used to extract a list of all the selected elements' text content.

Here .//div[@class="tags"]/a is a xpath expression to select all <a> tags under <div class="tags"> element.
In this case, the xpath is used to select the tags of the quotes, it will return a list of all the tags associated
with the quotes.

You can also use .get() method instead of .getall() if you only want to extract the text content of the first selected
element.

descendants of the current context node, regardless of their level of nesting.
